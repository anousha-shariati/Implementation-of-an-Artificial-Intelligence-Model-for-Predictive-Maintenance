# Implementation-of-an-Artificial-Intelligence-Model-for-Predictive-Maintenance

This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance (PM) model to anticipate repair needs for industrial equipment, particularly electric motors. Predictive maintenance leverages AI and deep learning algorithms to analyze real-time data from sensors, alerting technicians to potential issues before they result in costly downtime. This project aims to reduce maintenance costs, minimize unexpected breakdowns, and improve operational efficiency.

Predictive maintenance relies on AI and sensor data analysis to assess equipment health and predict breakdowns. Sensors track crucial parameters such as temperature, vibration, and current, which provide key insights into equipment health. Vibration, in particular, often shows the earliest signs of impending failure, making it a critical parameter in predictive models.

Project Objectives:

1.Data Analysis and Parameter Monitoring: Utilize sensor data to monitor essential parameters like vibration, temperature, and current, all collected from industrial datasets.

2.AI Model Design: Design an AI model to analyze sensor data for anomaly detection and failure prediction.

3:Optimal Parameter Selection: Identify the most effective parameters for predicting failures in electric motors.

4.Sampling Rate Optimization: Determine the ideal sampling rate to balance data accuracy and processing efficiency.
